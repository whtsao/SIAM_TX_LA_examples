# SIAM_TX_LA_examples
Three examples solved based on three models for SIAM_TX_LA presentations

1. A soliton runs up a slope and reflects from a vertical wall (Walkley, 1999)  
Two-phase RANS model - OK  
Potential-flow model - OK  
SWE model - OK  

2. Periodic waves propagate over a submerged obstacle (Beji and Battjes, 1994)  
Two-phase RANS model - OK  
Potential-flow model - OK  
SWE model - OK  

3. Tsunami-like wave runs up and overtops the seawall (Hsiao and Lin, 2010)  
Two-phase RANS model - OK  
Potential-flow model - curl wave wasn't shown  
SWE model - fixing NG results
