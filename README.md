# SIAM_TX_LA_examples
Three examples solved based on three models for SIAM_TX_LA presentations

1. A soliton runs up a slope and reflects from a vertical wall (Walkley, 1999)  
Walkley, M.A. A numerical method for extended boussinesq shallow-water wave equations. Ph.D. Thesis, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK, September 1999.  
Two-phase RANS model - OK  
Potential-flow model - OK  
SWE model - OK  

2. Periodic waves propagate over a submerged obstacle (Beji and Battjes, 1994)  
Beji, S. and Battjes, J.A., 1994. Numerical simulation of nonlinear wave propagation over a bar. Coastal Engineering, 23, 1-16.  
Two-phase RANS model - OK  
Potential-flow model - OK  
SWE model - OK  

3. Tsunami-like wave runs up and overtops the seawall (Hsiao and Lin, 2010)  
Hsiao, S.C. and Lin, T.C., 2010. Tsunami-like solitary waves impinging and overtopping an impermeable seawall: Experiment and RANS modeling. Coastal Engineering, 57, 1-18.  
Two-phase RANS model - OK  
Potential-flow model - curl wave wasn't shown  
SWE model - OK
